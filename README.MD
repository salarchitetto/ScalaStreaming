# Twitter Streaming

Just recently started to use Scala and I need to learn Apache Spark/Kafka. So what better way
to learn this by using streaming some twitter data. 

The end game for this project is just to get my bearings on how these technologies work. 
Hopefully I can transfer this data to a real time dashboard or something. 
Haven't thought that far ahead yet. Will update day by day.
